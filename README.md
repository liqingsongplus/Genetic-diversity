## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

``` r
library(genetic)   
data(E5b_hmp)      # load the SNPs data of common carp E5b CDS   
diveristy(E5b_hmp) # compute the genetic diversity of SNPs
ld_plot(E5b_hmp,E5b_hmp$pos) # LDheatmap.pdf will be generated in the current
directory

```
